ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* apktool.yml
* hongbo\
* hongbo\wordmate\
* hongbo\wordmate\C0009R.java
* hongbo\wordmate\DictLoader.java
* hongbo\wordmate\DownloadService.java
* hongbo\wordmate\DownloadViewer.java
* hongbo\wordmate\Downloader.java
* hongbo\wordmate\InputWatcher.java
* hongbo\wordmate\Settings.java
* hongbo\wordmate\UpdateManager.java
* hongbo\wordmate\WordMate.java
* hongbo\wordmate\WordlistAdapter.java
* hongbo\wordmate\dictionary\
* hongbo\wordmate\dictionary\BitReader.java
* hongbo\wordmate\dictionary\Cache.java
* hongbo\wordmate\dictionary\Dict.java
* hongbo\wordmate\dictionary\StarDict.java
* hongbo\wordmate\dictionary\WMDict.java

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => app\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml
* assets\ => app\src\main\assets
* res\ => app\src\main\res\
* src\ => app\src\main\java\

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.
